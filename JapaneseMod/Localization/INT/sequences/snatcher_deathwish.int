playerdied1 = [shake2]お前を殺すには骨がおれるが、しかし利益は大きい。ハッハッハ！[/shake2]
playerdied2 = [shake2]おや、心がおれそうだって？もう全てを放り出してあきらめたらどうだ。キッド[/shake2]
playerdied3 = [shake2]そんなに死んでしまうのが好きなら、死とチューしちゃえばいいのに！[/shake2]
playerdied4 = [shake2]ああ、これは悲劇だ。もし私がお前の立場だったら心がポキッとおれちゃうな。[/shake2]
playerdied5 = [shake2]何処に行った？お前がいないと寂しいじゃないか。失敗して失敗して失敗し続ける。素晴らしい時間を共に過ごすんじゃなかったのか！[/shake2]
playerdied6 = [shake2]私はお前がそれを台無しにするところを見ていたぞ。キッド...[/shake2]
playerdied7 = [shake2]生き急いでるな。ハァッ？もう死んだか。カワイイ死体を置き忘れているぞ。ツーアウトだ。スリーアウトで...わかるよな？[/shake2]
playerdied8 = [shake2]コツをつかんだか？うまくやれよ。キッド！[/shake2]
playerdied9 = [shake2]例のアレは楽しんでもらえたかい。キッド。まだまだ沢山あるからな、お替わりしてくれよ![/shake2]
playerdied10 = [shake2]オ〜ッホッホッ。ちっぽけな死なんて気にするな。契約を履行するんだ！さ、もう一度始めようじゃないか...[/shake2]
playerdied11 = [shake2]安らかに眠れる事に感謝するがいい...私に生きがいをくれて感謝する！[/shake2]
playerdied12 = [shake2]あらやだ。こんな簡単な契約からまだ脱出できていないのか![/shake2]
playerdied13 = [shake2]お〜っと！[/shake2]
playerdied14 = [shake2]ワォ！良くやった！なかなか素晴らしい仕事だ。キッド。才能あるぜ。[/shake2]
playerdied15 = [shake2]私はそれを渡す必要がある。キッド。もう、お前の様に誰かが死ぬ事もないだろう。[/shake2]
playerdied16 = [shake2]「永遠の親友」の事、後悔していないのか。キッド？ずっとそうだといいな。[/shake2]
playerdied17 = [shake2][wave]ああ[/wave]、そうだ。もっとうまくやれたかもしれない。[/shake2]
playerdied18 = [shake2]なんだ、その情けない声は？誰にも出来ない契約をお前はなし遂げたんだ。キッド[/shake2]
playerdied19 = [shake2]楽しかったな。ワクワクしたかい。キッド？[/shake2]
//TODOもう少し考える↑（要状況確認）
QuietMoment0 = [shake2]ヤツらは愛を暖く感じると言うが...私の経験上、ひどく[wave]冷めたものだよね。[/wave][/shake2]
QuietMoment1a = [shake2]今年度の税務申告書を提出しましたか？なんだって！[big]まだしていない？[/big]ああ少年。あなたは弁護士が必要になります！[/shake2]
QuietMoment1b = [shake2]あなた以外の弁護士を知らなかった。ちょっと待って。あなたがやる。私だ。少なくとも私もそうだが。これはあなたの訴訟だ。1つの魂が契約金として必要です。[/shake2]
QuietMoment2 = [shake2]ああ、あなたはあの日、ダイナマイトとレーザービームの様な彼女を監視しておくべきだった。ってね。[/shake2]
QuietMoment3 = [shake2]「死は避けられない。あなたの時間には価値がある」だって？誰が[icon:timestophat]時間停止の帽子に、こんなラベルつけたのだ？私は、この帽子がお前の為に作られたのだと思ったがな。[/shake2]
QuietMoment4 = [shake2]お前も私も、みんな魂の仲間を持っている。おそらく多分な。というのは、私が私であると知った上でお前は待っていてくれたからだ！にもかかわらず私は見て見ぬふりをしていた。[/shake2]
QuietMoment5 = [shake2]ヘイ。キッド。お前の両親を見たぞ。ちょうど挨拶に来ていたんだ。でも、お前が居なかったからな。既に出発したよ。[/wave]残念だったな。[/wave][/shake2]
QuietMoment6 = [shake2]You look just like your parents, you know that? At least I think you do - their spirits are looking kind of hazy. Just kidding! Or maybe not. [wave]Who can really tell.[/wave][/shake2]
QuietMoment7 = [shake2]You know, you signed up for this. Maybe you'll think twice before you change the terms of a contract next time, kid.[/shake2]
QuietMoment8 = [shake2]The best things in life are worth experiencing over and over, but most people only die once! [wave]You're soooooo lucky![/wave][/shake2]
QuietMoment9 = [shake2]I've got a lonely old friend who's living all by herself in a dusty old house. You should pay her a visit... her cookies are to [scream]DIE[/scream] for.[/shake2]
QuietMoment10 = [shake2]You might think the embrace of death is the coldest thing there is, but I can tell you from experience... it's not.[/shake2]
QuietMoment11 = [shake2]Remember the good old days when I tried to murder you? That was fun. We should do that again sometime.[/shake2]
QuietMoment12 = [shake2]This self-help book I've been reading has been worth every penny! I should really get you a copy.[/shake2]
QuietMoment13 = [shake2]Did you know you aren't supposed to kill your contractors? Apparently it's "illegal" or something. Lucky for us, I know a few loopholes![/shake2]
QuietMoment14 = [shake2]Don't give me that look, this is teamwork! I'm the team, you're the work. Now get to it, trooper![/shake2]
QuietMoment15 = [shake2]I love music, did you know that? My favorite track is, let's see... "DeathScream.wav". What a tune! Truly ahead of its time.[/shake2]
QuietMoment16 = [shake2]Here's a fun fact: There are no child labor laws in space![/shake2]
QuietMoment17 = [shake2]Did you know you can unlock a "Luigi" by completing every Death Wish on the first attempt? I don't even know what that is, but that has to be genuine. I read it online![/shake2]
QuietMoment18 = [shake2]I've got a new Death Wish for you, it's called "Quit To Desktop".[/shake2]
QuietMoment19 = [shake2]Hey kid, do you remember that angry little red girl? What was her deal anyway? She a friend of yours?[/shake2]
QuietMoment20 = [shake2]Hey, see that ledge over there? Jump off it! I want to see what happens.[/shake2]
QuietMoment21 = [shake2]Don't worry, kid. I'm an equal opportunity employer! All souls are good to me, regardless of age, race, gender, or their position on the endangered species list![/shake2]
QuietMoment22 = [shake2]You taking a break, kid? Oh, no I don't mind... I have an [wave]eternity[/wave]. YOU'RE the one who should be worried...[/shake2]
QuietMoment23 = [shake2]Don't mind me, kid. I'm only harassing you because it's encouraging! It's encouraging, right? [wave]Good![/wave][/shake2]
QuietMoment24 = [shake2]Burn some paintings, unclog a toilet, deliver some mail... Oh you thought my contracts were [wave]so easy[/wave] back then...[/shake2]
QuietMoment25 = [shake2]You know, that forest of mine used to look a lot different to how it does now... but that was a lifetime ago.[/shake2]

WindmillBirds0 = [shake2]These birds are so angry, I wonder why?[shake2]
WindmillBirds1 = [shake2]Looks like you're the only thing they can take it out on, though! How unfortunate.[shake2]
WindmillFire0 = [shake2]Whoops! Looks like everything's on fire. [wave]I wonder how that happened.[/wave][shake2]

[HeatingUpHarder]
Intro0 = [shake2]All this heat's great, eh? Personally I prefer freezing to death.[/shake2]
Intro1 = [shake2]Is it HOT in here, or is it just- oh, that's a lot of lava.[/shake2]
Intro2 = [shake2][wave][scream]アーーッハッハッハッハ！！もっと燃えろ！[/scream][/wave][/shake2]
Intro3 = [shake2]If I knew setting you on fire was this easy, I would have done it ages ago![/shake2]
Intro4 = [shake2]Hey kid, I think I see some icecream over there. [wave]Oops! It melted![/wave][/shake2]

Intro8 = [shake2]Getting too warm, kid? I'm sure there's someone here who can cool you off... for good.[/shake2]

[CruiseWorkingHard]
Intro0 = [shake2]Those seals are accident-prone, and incapable of performing the most basic tasks... and yet, they'd still be better at this than you.[/shake2]
Intro1 = [shake2]This captain guy is great! His dead eyes and musty smell reminds me of home.[/shake2]
Intro2 = [shake2]Did you know this cruise ship has a strict policy against stealing souls? It's ridiculous. I should sue![/shake2]
Intro3 = [shake2]Whoops! I just accidentally ordered a hundred drinks. And how did those babies get loose? [wave]Clumsy me![/wave][/shake2]

[NiceBirdhouse]
BirdHurt0 = [shake2]You're supposed to NOT kill the birds, remember?[/shake2]
BirdHurt1 = [shake2]Look what you did! Don't you feel [wave]ashamed?[/wave][/shake2]

BirdHurt5 = [shake2]That bird had three children! Guess they're orphans now. [wave]Ooops![/wave][/shake2]
BirdHurt6 = [shake2]You know you don't need to do that, right kid? This isn't one of those games that tries to make you feel bad.[/shake2]

[DeathWishMap]

[Speedrun]
Intro0 = [shake2]You gotta go fast, kid![/shake2]

Intro3 = [shake2]Be careful, kid. Don't [scream][big]TRIP![/big][/scream][/shake2]
Intro4 = [shake2]It's time to step on the gas, tonight![/shake2]
Intro5 = [shake2]What's the hurry, kid? It's not like you'll [scream][big]DIE[/big][/scream] if you slow down...[/shake2]
Intro6 = [shake2]Better start running, kiddo![/shake2]
Intro7 = [shake2]Face it kid, your speedrunning career was over before it even began.[/shake2]

deathwish_intro1 = [shake2]どうだい？お互いの為に、ささやかな取引関係を修復しようじゃないか？私は、お前に対し新鮮な契約を持って来る。お前が私の契約を履行出来れば報酬を受け取る事が出来る。もっとも生きていればの話だが。[/shake2]
deathwish_intro2 = [shake2][hint]この小さな地図[/hint]をお前にやろう。現在、ひとつの契約がマークされている事に気が付くだろう。契約の履行が完了するとチェックされ残りがアンロックされる。どうだ。健全な運営だろ？[/shake2]
deathwish_intro3 = [shake2]せいぜい気を付けるんだな。キッド。これはお前が今まで受けてきた普通の契約とは違う。...[wave]より高難度な契約だ。[/wave][/shake2]
deathwish_intro4 = [shake2]私はお前に仕事中、[scream][big]死んで[/big][/scream]欲しくないんだよ。[/shake2]
